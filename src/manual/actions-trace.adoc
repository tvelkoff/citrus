== Trace variables

You already know the <echo> action that prints messages to the console or logger. The <trace-variables> action is specially designed to trace all currently valid test variables to the console. This was mainly used by us for debug reasons. The usage is quite simple:

.XML DSL
[source,xml]
----
<testcase name="traceVariablesTest">
    <variables>
        <variable name="myVariable" value="12345"/>
        <variable name="nextVariable" value="54321"/>
    </variables>
    <actions>
        <trace-variables>
            <variable name="myVariable"/>
            <variable name="nextVariable"/>
        </trace-variables>
        
        <trace-variables/>
    </actions>
</testcase>
----

.Java DSL
[source,java]
----
@CitrusTest
public void traceTest() {
    variable("myVariable", "12345");
    variable("nextVariable", "54321");
    
    traceVariables("myVariable", "nextVariable");
    traceVariables();
}
----

Simply add the <trace-variables> action to your action chain and all variables will be printed out to the console. You are able to define a special set of variables by using the <variable> child elements. See the output that was generated by the test example above:

[source,xml]
----
Current value of variable myVariable = 12345
Current value of variable nextVariable = 54321
