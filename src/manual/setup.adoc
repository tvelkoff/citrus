[[setup]]
= Setup

This chapter discusses how to get started with Citrus. It deals with the installation and set up of the framework, so you
are ready to start writing test cases after reading this chapter.

Usually you would use Citrus as a dependency library in your project. In Maven you would just add Citrus as a test-scoped
dependency in your POM. When using ANT you can also run Citrus as normal Java application from your build.xml. As Citrus
tests are nothing but normal unit tests you could also use JUnit or TestNG ant tasks to execute the Citrus test cases.

This chapter describes the Citrus project setup possibilities, choose one of them that fits best to include Citrus into your project.

[[using-maven]]
== Using Maven

Citrus uses link:http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] internally as a project build tool and provides extended support for Maven projects.
Maven will ease up your life as it manages project dependencies and provides extended build life cycles and conventions for
compiling, testing, packaging and installing your Java project. Therefore it is recommended to use the Citrus Maven project setup.
In case you already use Maven it is most suitable for you to include Citrus as a test-scoped dependency.

As Maven handles all project dependencies automatically you do not need to download any Citrus project artifacts in advance.
If you are new to Maven please refer to the official Maven documentation to find out how to set up a Maven project.

[[maven-archetypes]]
=== Maven archetype

If you start from scratch or in case you would like to have Citrus operating in a separate Maven module you can use the
Citrus Maven archetype to create a new Maven project. The archetype will setup a basic Citrus project structure with basic
settings and files.

[source,xml]
----
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=com.consol.citrus.mvn:citrus
        
1: remote -> com.consol.citrus.mvn:citrus-quickstart (Citrus quickstart project)
2: remote -> com.consol.citrus.mvn:citrus-quickstart-jms (Citrus quickstart project with JMS consumer and producer)
3: remote -> com.consol.citrus.mvn:citrus-quickstart-soap (Citrus quickstart project with SOAP client and producer)
Choose a number: 1 

Define value for groupId: com.consol.citrus.samples
Define value for artifactId: citrus-sample
Define value for version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Define value for package: com.consol.citrus.samples
----

In the sample above we used the Citrus archetype available in Maven central repository.
As the list of default archetypes available in Maven central is very long, it has been filtered for official Citrus archetypes.

After choosing the Citrus quickstart archetype you have to define several values for your project: the groupId, the artifactId,
the package and the project version. After that we are done! Maven created a Citrus project structure for us which is
ready for testing. You should see the following basic project folder structure.

[source,xml]
----
citrus-sample
  |   + src
  |   |   + main
  |   |    |   + java
  |   |    |   + resources
  |   |   + test
  |   |    |   + java
  |   |    |   + resources
  pom.xml
----

The Citrus project is absolutely ready for testing. With Maven we can build, package, install and test our project right
away without any adjustments. Try to execute the following commands:

[source,xml]
----
mvn clean verify
mvn clean verify -Dit.test=MyFirstCitrusTest
----

NOTE: If you need additional assistance in setting up a Citrus Maven project please visit our Maven setup tutorial on
http://www.citfrusframework.org[http://www.citrusframework.org/tutorials.html].

[[existing-maven-projects]]
=== Existing Maven projects

In case you already have a proper Maven project you can also integrate Citrus with it. Just add the Citrus project dependencies
in your Maven pom.xml as a dependency like follows.

* We add Citrus as test-scoped project dependency to the project POM (pom.xml)
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.consol.citrus</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.7.7-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

* In case you would like to use the Citrus Java DSL also add this dependency to the project
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.consol.citrus</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-java-dsl</artifactId>
  <version>2.7.7-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

* Add the citrus Maven plugin to your project
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.consol.citrus.mvn</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.7.7-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <configuration>
    <author>Donald Duck</author>
    <targetPackage>com.consol.citrus</targetPackage>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

Now that we have added Citrus to our Maven project we can start writing new test cases with the Citrus Maven plugin:

[source,xml]
----
mvn citrus:create-test
----

Once you have written the Citrus test cases you can execute them automatically in your Maven software build lifecycle.
The tests will be included into your projects integration-test phase using the Maven failsafe plugin. Here is a sample failsafe configuration for Citrus.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.20</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>integration-tests</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>integration-test</goal>
        <goal>verify</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
 </plugin>
----

The Citrus test sources go to the default Maven test sources directory `src/test/java` and `src/test/resources`:

Now everything is set up and you can call the usual Maven *install* goal (`mvn clean install`) in order to build your project.
The Citrus integration tests are executed automatically during the build process. Besides that you can call the Maven *verify* phase explicitly to execute all Citrus tests or a specific test by its name including a validation of the test results.

[source,xml]
----
mvn clean verify
mvn clean verify -Dit.test=MyFirstCitrusIT
----

IMPORTANT: The Maven failsafe plugin by default executed tests with specific name pattern. This is because integration tests should not execute in Maven unit test phase, too. Therefore integration tests should follow
the failsafe name pattern with each test name beginning or ending with *'IT'*.

NOTE: If you need additional assistance in setting up a Citrus Maven project please visit our Maven setup tutorial on http://www.citfrusframework.org[http://www.citrusframework.org/tutorials.html].

[[using-gradle]]
== Using Gradle

As Citrus tests are nothing but normal JUnit or TestNG tests the integration to Gradle as build tool is as easy as adding the source files to a folder in your project. With the Gradle task execution for
integration tests you are able to execute the Citrus tests like you would do with normal unit tests.

[[gradle-configuration]]
=== Configuration

The Gradle build configuration is done in the **build.gradle** and **settings.gradle** files. Here we define the project name
and the project version.

[source,groovy]
----
rootProject.name = 'citrus-sample-gradle'
group 'com.consol.citrus.samples'
version '2.7.7-SNAPSHOT'
----

Now as Citrus libraries are available on Maven central repository we add these repositories so Gradle knows how to download the required
Citrus artifacts.

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url 'http://labs.consol.de/maven/snapshots-repository/'
    }
}
----

Citrus stable release versions are available on Maven central. If you want to use the very latest next version as snapshot preview you need
to add the ConSol Labs snapshot repository which is optional. Now lets move on with adding the Citrus libraries to the project.

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    testCompile group: 'com.consol.citrus', name: 'citrus-core', version: '2.7.7-SNAPSHOT'
    testCompile group: 'com.consol.citrus', name: 'citrus-java-dsl', version: '2.7.7-SNAPSHOT'
    testCompile group: 'org.testng', name: 'testng', version: '6.11'
    [...]
}
----

This enables the Citrus support for the project so we can use the Citrus classes and APIs. We decided to use TestNG unit test library.

[source,groovy]
----
test {
    useTestNG()
}
----

Of course JUnit is also supported. This is all for build configuration settings. We can move on to writing some Citrus integration tests. You can
find those tests in *src/test/java* directory.

[[gradle-run]]
=== Run with Gradle

You can use the Gradle wrapper for compile, package and test the sample with Gradle build command line.

[source,bash]
----
 gradlew clean build
----

This executes all Citrus test cases during the build and you will see Citrus performing some integration test logging output.
After the tests are finished build is successful and you are ready to go for writing some tests on your own.

If you just want to execute all tests you can call

[source,bash]
----
gradlew clean check
----

Of course you can also start the Citrus tests from your favorite IDE. Just start the Citrus test using the Gradle integration in IntelliJ, Eclipse or Netbeans.

[[using-ant]]
== Using Ant

Ant is a very popular way to compile, test, package and execute Java projects. The Apache project has effectively become a
standard in building Java projects. You can run Citrus test cases with Ant as Citrus is nothing but a Java application. This section describes the steps to setup a proper Citrus Ant project.

[[preconditions]]
=== Preconditions

Before we start with the Citrus setup be sure to meet the following preconditions. The following software should be installed on your computer, in order to use the Citrus framework:

* Java 8 or higher

Installed JDK plus JAVA_HOME environment variable set up and pointing to your Java installation directory

* Java IDE (optional)

A Java IDE will help you to manage your Citrus project (e.g. creating and executing test cases).
You can use the any Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA) but also any convenient XML Editor to write new test cases.

* Ant 1.8 or higher

Ant (http://ant.apache.org/[http://ant.apache.org/]) will run tests and compile your Citrus code extensions if necessary.

[[download]]
=== Download

First of all we need to download the latest Citrus release archive from the official website http://www.citrusframework.org[http://www.citrusframework.org]

Citrus comes to you as a zipped archive in one of the following packages:

* *citrus-x.x-release*
* *citrus-x.x-src*

The release package includes the Citrus binaries as well as the reference documentation and some sample applications.

In case you want to get in touch with developing and debugging Citrus you can also go with the source archive which gives
you the complete Citrus Java code sources. The whole Citrus project is also accessible for you on http://github.com/citrusframework/citrus[http://github.com/citrusframework/citrus].
This open git repository on GitHub enables you to build Citrus from scratch with Maven and contribute code changes.

[[installation]]
=== Installation

After downloading the Citrus archives we extract those into an appropriate location on the local storage. We are seeking for the
Citrus project artifacts coming as normal Java archives (e.g. citrus-core.jar, citrus-ws.jar, etc.)

You have to include those Citrus Java archives as well as all dependency libraries to your Apache Ant Java classpath. Usually you
would copy all libraries into your project's lib directory and declare those libraries in the Ant build file. As this approach can be
very time consuming I recommend to use a dependency management API such as Apache Ivy which gives you automatic dependency resolution like that from Maven.
In particular this comes in handy with all the 3rd party dependencies that would be resolved automatically.

No matter what approach you are using to set up the Apache Ant classpath see the following sample Ant build script which uses the
Citrus project artifacts in combination with the TestNG Ant tasks to run the tests.
